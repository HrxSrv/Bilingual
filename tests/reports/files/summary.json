    "executive_summary": "Over the course of these meetings, the team established a clear schedule to launch a new product next quarter and identified key marketing milestones. The first discussion finalized the decision for a next-quarter launch, tasked John with preparing a marketing plan by August 1st, and flagged the need to review the campaign budget. The subsequent meeting confirmed that the marketing team completed an initial campaign design, requiring stakeholder approval by the following week. Budget reviews continued, with Lisa highlighting the possibility of increasing digital marketing spending. A stakeholder review meeting is to be scheduled for Friday, with final budget allocations pending confirmation. Overall, the discussions emphasize timely preparation for the launch, thorough budget planning, and coordinated stakeholder engagement to ensure a successful campaign rollout.",
